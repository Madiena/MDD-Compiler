# MDD Compiler



## Usage

For using the program, run the main class with one of the following arguments:

- --gen: Generates HMTL Code from input.txt.
- --disc: Discovers HTML Code of all available generated html files.
- --help: Prints usage information.

## Tests

To run test files choose file TestWebsiteParser.scala (for testing Parser and Generator) or file TestDiscoverer.scala 
(for testing Discoverer) in your run configurations without any arguments. If using a Jetbrains IDE one may also simply
use the run buttons that are located right at the definition of the main methods in each file.
